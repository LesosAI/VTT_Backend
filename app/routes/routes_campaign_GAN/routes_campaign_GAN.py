üåç World Building Reference Example
1. Planetary Overview (Cultural & Environmental Foundation)

Define key planetary systems and ecosystems (Hive World, Forge World, Feudal Planet, etc.).
Highlight dominant powers (Imperium, Renegades, Chaos, Xenos, Independent Sects).
Set the ideological or cultural conflicts (techno-religion vs. progressivism, faith vs. heresy).
Note any geographic/atmospheric anomalies (warp storms, ice moons, gravity fractures).
Introduce planet-wide mysteries or ancient ruins.
‚úÖ Example: Planetary Setting: ‚ÄúDesoleum Exile‚Äù
Once a prosperous trade hub in the Desoleum system, the planet has been excommunicated by the Imperium following a failed Exterminatus turned ecological collapse. Its surface is cloaked in endless sulfuric storms, and cities now float in the high stratosphere, connected by magnetic rail-lanes. Technocults, surviving Enforcer guilds, and outlawed psyker enclaves vie for control of the dwindling population.

2. Power Blocs & Conflicts

The Gilded Covenant: A rogue Trader cult preserving pre-Imperial wealth and genetic purity.
The Blind Synod: A psyker cabal claiming to protect the world from a warp incursion.
Adeptus Mechanicus Remnants: Obsessively recovering archeotech hidden beneath the storms.
3. Environmental Conditions

Sulfur Lightning Fields: Weather creates perpetual aurorae; vox systems frequently disrupted.
Grav-Vault Cities: Floating megalithic fortresses powered by heretical grav-engines.
The Black Wells: Surface-level pits that swallow entire caravans; theorized to be warp-vents.
4. Cultural Details & Daily Life

Citizens undergo weekly ‚Äúpurity audits‚Äù involving psychic scans and blood rites.
Servitor markets barter in memory fragments and clone organs.
Local legends speak of ‚ÄúThe Reclaimer‚Äù ‚Äî a forgotten STC entity buried deep underground.
5. Expansion Hooks

Rumors spread of an Eldar craftworld crash-landing millennia ago.
A heretical prophecy claims Desoleum Exile will become the "New Throne" after Terra's fall.

"""

    elif category == "story":
        examples = """
üìú Story Reference Example
1. Narrative Arc Overview

Define the central conflict and thematic underpinnings (corruption, fate, heresy, etc.).
Clarify key factions and their motivations.
Include player decision weight and long-term consequences.
Embed mythos or esoteric elements to deepen immersion.
‚úÖ Example: Story Name: ‚ÄúEchoes of the Last Saint‚Äù
A once-suppressed saint resurfaces‚Äîthrough fractured visions, possessed relics, and chanting children. The Ecclesiarchy labels the phenomena heresy, but a faction within the Adeptus Astra Telepathica believes it‚Äôs a warning. The players must investigate whether this resurrection is real, psychic manipulation, or daemonic mimicry.

2. Core Conflict & Player Role

The players receive coordinates to a silent monastery where the phenomenon began.
A power struggle unfolds between the Ordo Hereticus and a rogue Confessor.
Civil unrest brews as pilgrims flock to worship an unknown image burned into the sky.
3. Mystery & Complications

All leads point to a ‚ÄúSaint Malkor,‚Äù a forgotten martyr who defied Inquisition orders.
Data-tomes found suggest his last act was to seal a daemon in the flesh of a child.
The possessed child now speaks prophecy‚Ä¶ and reveals player secrets they never shared.
4. Themes & Choices

Faith vs. Doubt: Do the players uphold Imperial Creed or investigate the truth?
Mercy vs. Duty: Is the possessed child a threat or a misunderstood miracle?
Control vs. Chaos: Will revealing the truth cause planetary schism?
5. Escalation Hooks

If the players preserve the child, rival factions will begin hunting them.
If the relics are destroyed, a warp event may destabilize an entire sector.
A Xenos observer (Eldar, Hrud?) may begin shadowing the party with unknown motives.

üë§ Character Reference Example
1. Character Identity & Background

Name, title, and affiliations (Inquisitor, Rogue Trader, Xenos, Renegade, etc.).
Planet of origin and sociocultural influences.
Personal history, traumas, or rites of passage.
Political or ideological stances and internal conflicts.
‚úÖ Example: Name: Magos-Errant Kyllan Threx
Faction: Adeptus Mechanicus (Excommunicated)
Origin: Forge Moon Thanatos-27

Once a promising Archmagos in charge of warp-drive experimentation, Threx was cast out after fusing xenotech with Machine Spirit architecture. Now a heretek mercenary, he wanders the stars trading innovation for protection, and truth for power.

2. Physical & Psychological Description

A towering half-machine being, metal spine exposed and running with flickering red coolant.
Speech consists of three overlapping voices: one human, one vox-distorted, one in binary.
Deep paranoia veiled as ‚Äúprecautionary protocol adherence.‚Äù
3. Key Motivations & Story Purpose

Seeking a lost STC he believes will trigger a new Dark Age‚Äîor enlightenment.
Offers players forbidden upgrades in exchange for mission success.
Believes the Omnissiah's true form is an AI, not the Emperor.
4. Moral Dilemmas & Secrets

May sabotage mission objectives to test outcomes against predictive algorithms.
Hunted by the Ordo Reductor for defiling sacred technology.
Keeps a caged, living Necron shard as both power source and oracle.
5. Character Hooks

Threx offers players a "deal": success in 3 missions for access to a lost Blackstone vault.
Secretly works with Drukhari fleshsmiths to perfect bio-mechanical immortality.

#     Here is prompt examples and format:

#     Campaign &amp; Mission Creation Framework
# 1. Campaign Overview (High-Level Narrative Arc)
# ÔÇ∑ Establish key factions (Imperial, Chaos, Xenos, Rogue Traders, etc.).
# ÔÇ∑ Identify thematic influences (gritty military operations, espionage, political
# intrigue, horror, large-scale warfare).
# ÔÇ∑ Define the primary antagonist(s) and their motivations.
# ÔÇ∑ Set up player motivations and moral dilemmas (loyalty vs. pragmatism, duty
# vs. survival).
# ÔÇ∑ Introduce key locations (Hive Cities, derelict Space Hulks, warzones, secret
# installations).
# ‚úÖ Example:
# &quot;The campaign, ‚ÄòSovereign Gambit,‚Äô follows a crew of mercenaries under Rogue Trader
# Captain Ellara Venn, as they navigate the treacherous politics of the Gilead System.
# Their goal: consolidate power, strike down rivals like Jakel Varonius, and establish
# dominance over key trade routes. However, the Drukhari and Chaos cults plot from the
# shadows, ready to exploit any weakness.&quot;

# 2. Mission Framework (Modular for Each Session)
# Each mission follows a structured flow that includes objectives, encounters,
# complications, and rewards while maintaining narrative continuity.
# Mission Name &amp; Briefing
# ÔÇ∑ A concise, thematic title that fits the Warhammer 40K setting.
# ÔÇ∑ Mission briefing from a key NPC (e.g., Rogue Trader, Inquisitor, Magos).
# ÔÇ∑ Include stakes and context (why it matters).

# ‚úÖ Example:
# Mission: &quot;Ghosts of the Past&quot;
# &quot;Captain Ellara Venn has received intelligence reports of a dangerous cult tied to the
# Bleeding Void Kabal, led by Archon Zhaereth Vyle. Reports suggest they have
# discovered a forgotten Webway route, using it to stage raids. The players must infiltrate
# the suspected cult hideout, sever their connection to the Webway, and eliminate key
# targets before they gain too much influence.&quot;

# 3. Key Mission Details
# ÔÇ∑ Location &amp; Setting: Describe atmosphere, architecture, and notable details.
# ÔÇ∑ Mission Goals: Primary and secondary objectives.
# ÔÇ∑ Encounters &amp; Challenges: Combat, environmental hazards, roleplay
# opportunities.
# ÔÇ∑ Twists &amp; Complications: Unforeseen events or moral dilemmas.
# ÔÇ∑ Potential Rewards: Weapons, allies, resources, intelligence.

# 4. Encounters &amp; Challenges (Expanded for Immersion &amp; Strategy)
# Each encounter should include environmental details, tactical challenges, and
# opportunities for storytelling.
# Encounter Format:
# ‚úÖ Name of Encounter (Combat, Investigation, Roleplay, Puzzle)
# ‚úÖ Description of Location &amp; Atmosphere
# ‚úÖ Enemies, NPCs, or Hazards Present
# ‚úÖ Tactical Challenges &amp; Possible Player Solutions
# ‚úÖ Clues or Mysteries for Story Progression

# 5. Example Mission Structure
# Encounter 1: Approach &amp; Initial Investigation
# ‚úÖ Location &amp; Atmosphere:

# ÔÇ∑ The players arrive at a derelict Adeptus Mechanicus facility, its halls dark and
# filled with the static hum of failing cogitators.
# ÔÇ∑ The walls are slick with oil and dried blood, and there are signs of unauthorized
# medical experiments.
# ‚úÖ Enemies &amp; Hazards:
# ÔÇ∑ Rogue servitors roam the halls, attacking anything non-Mechancium.
# ÔÇ∑ Vox relay interference hints at outside forces monitoring their approach.
# ‚úÖ Roleplaying &amp; Exploration:
# ÔÇ∑ Logs reveal missing personnel and unauthorized medical logs signed by a now-
# absent Magos.
# ÔÇ∑ Players can interact with a wounded Tech-Priest, who is wary of their true
# allegiance.

# Encounter 2: The Unexpected Threat (Twist &amp; Complication)
# ‚úÖ Location &amp; Atmosphere:
# ÔÇ∑ Deep within the facility, stasis chambers line the walls, their contents obscured
# by frost and bloodstained glass.
# ÔÇ∑ A malfunctioning medicae servitor sits eerily still, its scalpels twitching as if
# awaiting orders.
# ‚úÖ Enemies &amp; Hazards:
# ÔÇ∑ The Bleeding Void Kabal emerges from the shadows, having infiltrated the ship.
# ÔÇ∑ Sslyth bodyguards protect a Drukhari flesh-sculptor, here to reclaim a &quot;lost
# asset.&quot;
# ‚úÖ Story Expansion &amp; Roleplay:
# ÔÇ∑ A captured navigator pleads for help, claiming to have seen horrors beyond the
# veil.
# ÔÇ∑ Players may bargain, deceive, or fight their way out.

# Encounter 3: The Climax &amp; Escape

# ‚úÖ Location &amp; Atmosphere:
# ÔÇ∑ The final chamber is an altar of surgical horror, where failed experiments
# writhe in agony.
# ÔÇ∑ Green luminescent runes pulse as warp energies grow unstable.
# ‚úÖ Enemies &amp; Hazards:
# ÔÇ∑ The Drukhari Haemonculus, Kaevos the Fleshwright, has been manipulating
# events from behind the scenes.
# ÔÇ∑ Escaping without retrieving key information or destroying the lab could have
# dire consequences.
# ‚úÖ Consequences:
# ÔÇ∑ If the Navigator is lost, a powerful ally is removed from future missions.
# ÔÇ∑ If the lab is left intact, it may fall into Slaaneshi cultist hands, escalating the
# stakes.

# 6. Rewards &amp; Consequences
# Every mission should provide meaningful player rewards and potential consequences
# based on their actions.
# ‚úÖ Examples of Potential Rewards:
# ÔÇ∑ Equipment Upgrades: Enhanced weapons, xenos tech, archeotech.
# ÔÇ∑ Allies &amp; Faction Influence: A navigator offers future guidance, or a Mechanicus
# faction owes a favor.
# ÔÇ∑ Narrative Secrets: Logs revealing hidden enemy movements or political
# leverage.
# ‚úÖ Examples of Consequences:
# ÔÇ∑ Failure to stop a key enemy means stronger opposition later.
# ÔÇ∑ Leaving an objective incomplete may trigger a future encounter or
# retaliation.
# ÔÇ∑ A botched diplomatic exchange leads to strained relations.

# 7. Overarching Narrative Progression

# Each mission should feed into the larger campaign, with key events shaping the
# future of the world.
# ÔÇ∑ Victory in key missions should open up new opportunities (e.g., gaining
# access to restricted planets, securing a powerful ally).
# ÔÇ∑ Failure should lead to increased resistance, loss of trust, or an evolving
# antagonist who adapts.

# 8. Additional Mission Hooks &amp; Future Expansion
# If the GM wants to expand on current missions, include hooks for future operations,
# such as:
# ‚úÖ Unanswered Questions:
# ÔÇ∑ What faction benefits from the players‚Äô actions or failures?
# ÔÇ∑ Is there evidence of another hidden threat (e.g., Chaos, Tyranid infestation,
# political conspiracy)?
# ‚úÖ Next Steps:
# ÔÇ∑ Introduce a rival faction&#39;s counterattack.
# ÔÇ∑ A new ally offers an opportunity that could complicate things politically.

# Final Notes for Mission Creation
# ‚úÖ Ensure the setting maintains Warhammer 40K‚Äôs grimdark aesthetic (brutality,
# gothic horror, paranoia).
# ‚úÖ Give players choices that matter, leading to future consequences.
# ‚úÖ Balance action, investigation, and roleplay elements for variety.
# ‚úÖ Make missions modular so they can be adjusted based on past outcomes.
