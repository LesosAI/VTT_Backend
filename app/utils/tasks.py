üåç World Building Reference Example
1. Planetary Overview (Cultural & Environmental Foundation)

Define key planetary systems and ecosystems (Hive World, Forge World, Feudal Planet, etc.).
Highlight dominant powers (Imperium, Renegades, Chaos, Xenos, Independent Sects).
Set the ideological or cultural conflicts (techno-religion vs. progressivism, faith vs. heresy).
Note any geographic/atmospheric anomalies (warp storms, ice moons, gravity fractures).
Introduce planet-wide mysteries or ancient ruins.
‚úÖ Example: Planetary Setting: "Desoleum Exile"
Once a prosperous trade hub in the Desoleum system, the planet has been excommunicated by the Imperium following a failed Exterminatus turned ecological collapse. Its surface is cloaked in endless sulfuric storms, and cities now float in the high stratosphere, connected by magnetic rail-lanes. Technocults, surviving Enforcer guilds, and outlawed psyker enclaves vie for control of the dwindling population.

2. Power Blocs & Conflicts

The Gilded Covenant: A rogue Trader cult preserving pre-Imperial wealth and genetic purity.
The Blind Synod: A psyker cabal claiming to protect the world from a warp incursion.
Adeptus Mechanicus Remnants: Obsessively recovering archeotech hidden beneath the storms.
3. Environmental Conditions

Sulfur Lightning Fields: Weather creates perpetual aurorae; vox systems frequently disrupted.
Grav-Vault Cities: Floating megalithic fortresses powered by heretical grav-engines.
The Black Wells: Surface-level pits that swallow entire caravans; theorized to be warp-vents.
4. Cultural Details & Daily Life

Citizens undergo weekly "purity audits" involving psychic scans and blood rites.
Servitor markets barter in memory fragments and clone organs.
Local legends speak of "The Reclaimer" ‚Äî a forgotten STC entity buried deep underground.
5. Expansion Hooks

Rumors spread of an Eldar craftworld crash-landing millennia ago.
A heretical prophecy claims Desoleum Exile will become the "New Throne" after Terra's fall.
